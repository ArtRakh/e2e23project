# End-to-End ML Project for predicting house rental prices
Steps taken:
- exploratory data analysis of dataset from [Yandex.Realty](https://realty.ya.ru/) for the market of **St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast (2016-2018)** - _not in the repository_
- research for a machine learning model to solve the task (decision tree was chosen) - _not in the repository_
- using a remote machine (from Y.Cloud), running my ML method for predicting prices (both the model and the scalers were wrapped in .pkl files), it's available to examine the GET method used via app.py file in the repository 
- building a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/artrakh/e2e23_class_predictor) for the method to have an opportunity of running it within any environments
- checking the correctness of the method by Postman, running the image from the virtual machine with the public IP: 51.250.20.152

Hurray! ![image](https://github.com/ArtRakh/e2e23project/assets/114469896/b289d4d5-3a4f-4f12-acc1-57275de8944a)
